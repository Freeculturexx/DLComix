Description of the application
##############################

The application DLComix is an application like Dailystrips to download online comics from the web. 

The first step will be to have the last picture of the day.

Then I will start script to download the whole directory of different comics

But the most important will be to support the largest number of comics !! 

Install of DLComix
##################

You will need git-core package. For a Debian based distribution, make a
apt-get install git-core
as root

Go on the folder you want to put DLComix, and make
git clone git://github.com/Freeculture/DLComix.git
 
To install it, go in DLComix folder and make a 
python setup.py install 
as root

That's all

Download your first comic
#########################

With dlcomix, you have two options
-c or --comic 
	where you put the comic name. All supported comics are in List_of_Comics file
	Put the name on the second column
-p or --path (optional)
	Path where you want to download comic. If none, DLComix will create the
	~/.dlcomix/download folder

The exemple
-----------

Imagine you want to download the last Garfield comic

Do a
dlcomix -c garfield

I hope you will enjoy it
